## Overview

Learn the properties of **Timeline** to achieve awesome animations!

A **Timeline** represents the duration, delay and easing of a specific movement of a layer.

> **Example:**
> 
> If a layer moves from left to right, **Timeline**  allows us to control how much time this movement will take (duration), if there is a delay, and the easing

## Timelines Properties

* Each layer can have its own **Timeline** 
* By moving and stretching a **Timeline** , you can determine the delay and duration of a specific animation
* To control the  **delay** of an animation, drag the **Timeline**  left or right
* To control the **duration** of an animation, stretch or shrink the **Timeline**

### Delay

### Duration

### Curve

Manages the easing function which determines rate of change of a parameter over time. 

In other words: "How to change a value (for example position of layer) over time".

- **Linear:** As time moves along, the value increases in equal amounts
  
- **Ease-In:** Causes the animation to start more quickly than linear ones, and it also has deceleration at the end
  
- **Ease Out:** This is the opposite of Ease-In. Animation starts slow and ends fast
  
- **Ease In Out:** Slow start, fast middle, and slow end
